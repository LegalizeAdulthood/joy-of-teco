     Introduction

     The Video Terminal Editor (called VTEDIT) is  a  feature  of  the
     TECO text editor which is available under RSTS/E, RT-11, RSX-11M,
     IAS, and VAX/VMS.  VTEDIT allows you to see all  changes  to  the
     text as you make them.

     The Video Terminal Editor has two parts:

        o The scope driver, which keeps the terminal  screen  updated,
          is a part of the TECO run-time system (RSTS/E), the TECO.SAV
          program (RT-11), the TEC.TSK task (RSX-11M and IAS), or  the
          TEC.EXE image (VAX/VMS).

        o The keyboard interface, which accepts your typed  input  and
          either  inserts  it into the text buffer or interprets it as
          an editing command, is a TECO macro called VTEDIT.TEC.

     This document describes the scope driver and  the  VTEDIT  macro.
     The  scope driver is a standard part of TECO.  However, VTEDIT is
     just one of many possible keyboard interfaces.  Your installation
     may  have  modified it, and therefore may have its own version of
     the scope editing keyboard interface.


     How to Read this Manual

     The following conventions are used throughout this manual:

        o A underlined dollar sign ($)  indicates  typing  the  ESCape                                    _
          key,  or  the  ESCape  key  surrogate (usually accent grave,
          "`"), if enabled.

        o The notation 'CTRL/x' indicates a control  character,  which
          you  enter  by  holding  down  the  CTRL  key and typing the
          indicated character.

        o Items in square brackets are optional.

        o The letter 'n' indicates a numeric argument.   You  enter  a
          numeric  argument  by  typing  $[-]  followed by a series of                                         _
          digits.  The short sequence $- is equivalent  to  $-1.   The                                      _                     _
          first  non-numeric  keystroke  you  type  after  entering  a
          numeric argument should be an editing function  which  takes
          an  argument.   Any other keystroke will cause the editor to
          discard the number.  (It is  also  possible  for  a  numeric
          argument to be an expression using standard operators.  This
          is discussed later in the manual.) Unless otherwise  stated,
          the editor uses a default value of 1 if you omit an optional
          argument.

        o The letter 'q' indicates any alphabetic Q-register name.  If
          the  syntax of the editor requires a Q-register name and you
          type  any  non-alphabetic  character,  VTEDIT   sounds   the
          terminal bell and ignores the command.

     Invoking the Video Terminal Editor Macro

     The Video Terminal Editor macro is stored in the file VTEDIT.TEC.
     For  RSTS/E and VAX/VMS, the file is usually stored in the system
     library (TECO$:  for RSTS/E, SYS$LIBRARY:  for  VAX/VMS).   Other
     operating  systems  may  store VTEDIT.TEC elsewhere;  this manual
     uses RSTS/E for its examples.  When you use the macro, it resides
     in  Q-register  I  and uses all of the numeric Q-registers.  (The
     macro saves these Q-registers when it starts  and  restores  them
     when  it  exits, but they are unavailable from command mode while
     the macro is  executing.)  To  load  Q-register  I  with  VTEDIT,
     execute the following TECO command:

                      EITECO$:VTEDIT$$                                    __

     The message 'VTEDIT.TEC  loaded  into  Q-Reg  I'  is  printed  to
     confirm the load.  Start the macro by typing the TECO command:

                            MI$$                              __

     These two commands cannot be in the same command  sequence.   You
     must execute the EI command before you can execute Q-register I.

     If you use the CCL commands TECO or MAKE to invoke TECO, you  can
     automatically  load  and  start the VTEDIT macro by including the
     following switch after the CCL command name:

                            /VT

     If you always  want  VTEDIT  included,  create  a  TECO  start-up
     command  file  called  TECO.INI  in  your account.  This file can
     contain any TECO commands, and  should  end  with  the  following
     commands:

                      ET&512"N 1+ ' 0

     Then, whenever you use the TECO or MAKE CCL commands on  a  VT52,
     VT100  series, or VT200 series terminal, TECO automatically loads
     and starts VTEDIT.  To suppress  this  loading,  you  must  start
     editing with the command:

                       RUN TECO$:TECO

     The model TECO.INI file included on the RSTS/E TECO  distribution
     does  a  more advanced set of checks as well as implementing some
     other random things (such as humorous messages based on the  time
     of day).  Of course, experimentation is encouraged.

     Interpreting the Terminal Screen

     While you are running  the  Video  Terminal  Editor  macro,  your
     terminal  screen  displays  up  to 24 lines of the text in TECO's
     text buffer.  This 'window' into your buffer always includes  the
     current  line  (the  line  containing  the  text  pointer).   The
     location of the text pointer within the buffer  is  indicated  by
     the  terminal's  cursor.   All  characters  that  you type on the
     keyboard that are not commands to VTEDIT are immediately inserted
     into  the  text  buffer  at  the current pointer position and are
     displayed on the screen.

     Certain other special symbols can appear on the screen:

        o A square  blob  (VT52)  or  'FF'  symbol  (VT100  or  VT200)
          indicates  the  end  of  your text buffer and signifies that
          there is an implicit form feed at the end of the buffer.

        o A paragraph  symbol  (VT52)  or  diamond  (VT100  or  VT200)
          indicates  the  end  of  your  text  buffer  if  there is no
          implicit form feed there.

        o A paragraph  symbol  (VT52)  or  diamond  (VT100  or  VT200)
          immediately  following  one  of the buffer end symbols above
          signifies that your input file is at end-of-file.

        o A  down  arrow  (VT52)  or  'LF'  symbol  (VT100  or  VT200)
          indicates  that  the  text  pointer  is positioned between a
          carriage return and a line feed.  This symbol  appears  only
          as  the  first  symbol  on a line, and it overlays the first
          character of the line.  It allows you to tell the difference
          between  the  text  pointer  being at the start of a line of
          text and being just before the end of it.

        o A right  arrow  (VT52)  or  'NL'  symbol  (VT100  or  VT200)
          indicates  that  the current line of text is too long to fit
          on the current line of the screen.  If TECO's truncate  flag
          bit  (bit  8, value 256) is not set in the ET flag word (the
          normal case), the remainder of the text appears on the  next
          line  of  the  screen, preceded by the right arrow (VT52) or
          'NL' (VT100 or VT200) and a space.  If the truncate flag  is
          set  (via  the  TECO command ET#256ET), the remainder of the
          text is not displayed, but the special symbol appears at the
          end  of  the  line  to  remind you that there are characters
          which cannot be displayed.  You can control  the  number  of
          characters  that  appear  on  each  line by using the CTRL/V
          command.

     If you are using a VT100 or VT200 terminal in ANSI  mode,  VTEDIT
     will  display  any  text between the current text pointer and the
     marked buffer location (see the  Set  Mark  command)  in  reverse
     video to highlight the marked region.

     A feature of the scope driver which allows you to view the  exact
     contents  of  your  text  buffer  is called 'see-all' mode.  When
     see-all mode is turned on,  all  special  characters  and  hidden
     spacing are visible on the screen as special graphic symbols:

          TAB       appears as a degree sign  (VT52)  or  'HT'  symbol
                    (VT100  or  VT200).   The  spacing  after the tab,
                    which is normally blank space on the  screen  that
                    does not correspond to any characters in the text,
                    is  shown  as  a  series  of  ellipses  (VT52)  or
                    centered dots (VT100 or VT200).

          LINE FEED not immediately preceeded by a RETURN appears as a
                    down-arrow (VT52) or 'LF' symbol (VT100 or VT200).
                    If the line feed is in the middle of the line, the
                    blank  space  at the beginning of the next line is
                    filled (as for TAB).

                    A LINE FEED immediately  after  a  RETURN  is  not
                    displayed  with  any  special  symbol  (see RETURN
                    below).

          RETURN    followed by a line feed appears as a  'CD'  symbol
                    (VT52) or 'CR' symbol (VT100 or VT200).  Any blank
                    space before the end of the line is thus visible.

                    A RETURN causing an overprint line (i.e., a RETURN
                    not  immediately  followed by a LINE FEED) appears
                    as a five-slash (VT52)  or  not-equals  (VT100  or
                    VT200).  The overprint characters are displayed on
                    the  next  line  instead   of   over   (and   thus
                    clobbering)  the original characters.  This allows
                    full viewing of all characters in overprint lines.

          FORM FEED appears as a square blob  (VT52)  or  'FF'  symbol
                    (VT100 or VT200).  No extra blank lines are shown.
                    If the form feed is in the middle of the line, the
                    blank  space  at the beginning of the next line is
                    filled.

          VERTICAL TAB appears as  a  division  sign  (VT52)  or  'VT'
                    symbol  (VT100  or VT200).  If the vertical tab is
                    in the middle of the line, the blank space at  the
                    beginning of the next line is filled.

          ESCAPE    appears as a three-slash  (VT52)  or  a  Greek  pi
                    (VT100  or  VT200) to distinguish it from a dollar
                    sign.

          CTRL/x    appears as a plus-or-minus sign  followed  by  the
                    character  'x'  to  distinguish  it  from  a  real
                    uparrow.

     Editing Text

     In addition to allowing you to enter  text,  the  Video  Terminal
     Editor macro has a large repertoire of powerful editing commands.
     You request an editing function by using the auxiliary keypad  on
     the terminal or by typing control characters or control sequences
     on the standard keyboard.  Some functions  require  you  to  type
     several keys.

     When you start the Video Terminal  Editor  macro  with  the  TECO
     command:

                           -1MI$$                               __

     it draws a keypad layout on the screen.  This is a summary of the
     available  editing  functions.   You  can  redisplay  this keypad
     layout by  using  the  ESCape  H  command  (see  the  section  on
     Miscellaneous Commands).

     The following sections describe the editing  functions  available
     in  VTEDIT.   When  an editing function is equivalent to a simple
     TECO  command,  the  equivalent   command   appears   after   the
     description.   The macro sounds the terminal bell when it detects
     an error (such as $!, which is an illegal sequence).                       _

                     Moving the Cursor


          Command:  Set Mark

          Syntax:   9         (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Mark the current text buffer pointer position  for
                    use with later commands (see individual commands).
                    To move the mark, simply type the 9 key at the new
                    position.   If you type the 9 key when the pointer
                    is at the marked position, the mark is removed and
                    the bell sounds.  Thus, to remove a mark, type the
                    9 key until the bell rings.  The  mark  is  always
                    removed when it is used.


          Command:  Jump

          Syntax:   [n]1      (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Move the text pointer to position n.  If n is  not
                    given  but  a  mark  is  set,  jump  to  the mark.
                    Otherwise, jump  to  the  beginning  of  the  text
                    buffer.

          In TECO:  nJ


          Command:  Jump to End of Buffer

          Syntax:   2         (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Move the text pointer  to  the  end  of  the  text
                    buffer.

          In TECO:  ZJ


          Command:  Advance Line

          Syntax:   [n]0      (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Advance the text pointer by n lines, leaving it at
                    the beginning of a line.

          In TECO:  nL

          Command:  Back Line

          Syntax:   [n]4      (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Back up the text pointer by n lines, leaving it at
                    the beginning of a line.

          In TECO:  -nL


          Command:  Start of Line

          Syntax:   3         (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Move the text pointer to the start of the  current
                    line.

          In TECO:  0L


          Command:  End of Line

          Syntax:   [n]BACKSPACE (special key or CTRL/H)

          Meaning:  Move the text pointer to the end of the  nth  line
                    from  the  current  line.  If n is not given or is
                    equal to 1, move to the end of the  current  line.
                    The  end  of  the  line  is just before a carriage
                    return or form feed.

          In TECO:  nL 2R


          Command:  Advance Character

          Syntax:   [n]>      (right arrow keypad key)                       -

          Meaning:  Advance the text pointer by n characters.

          In TECO:  nC


          Command:  Back Character

          Syntax:   [n]<      (left arrow keypad key)                       -

          Meaning:  Back up the text pointer by n characters.

          In TECO:  nR

          Command:  Down in Column

          Syntax:   [n]v      (down arrow keypad key)                       |

          Meaning:  Advance the text pointer by n lines, keeping it in
                    the same column of the screen if possible.  Column
                    position is determined by counting characters  and
                    expanding  TABs.   If  the  target line is shorter
                    than the position of the pointer at the start, the
                    pointer  is  left  at the end of the line.  If the
                    desired column in the target line is in the middle
                    of  a  tab  stop,  the  pointer is left at the TAB
                    character.  Repeatedly typing this key and the  up
                    arrow   key   preserves  the  target  column,  and
                    repositions to it when possible.


          Command:  Up in Column

          Syntax:   [n]^      (up arrow keypad key)                       |

          Meaning:  Back up the text pointer by n lines, keeping it in
                    the same column of the screen if possible.  Column
                    position is determined by counting characters  and
                    expanding  TABs.   If  the  target line is shorter
                    than the position of the pointer at the start, the
                    pointer  is  left  at the end of the line.  If the
                    desired column in the target line is in the middle
                    of  a  tab  stop,  the  pointer is left at the TAB
                    character.  Repeatedly typing  this  key  and  the
                    down  arrow  key  preserves the target column, and
                    repositions to it when possible.


          Command:  Advance Word

          Syntax:   [n]CTRL/F

          Meaning:  Advance the text pointer by n words, leaving it at
                    the  first  character  of the nth word.  Words are

          Command:  Advance or Back Continuously

          Syntax:   $ followed by one of the six motion  commands  for                    _
                    advance  or  back  by  line  (0 or 4 keypad keys),
                    character (left or right arrow  keypad  keys),  or
                    word (CTRL/F or CTRL/R)

          Meaning:  Move the text pointer  continuously  by  one  unit
                    (line,   character,   or  word)  in  the  selected
                    direction,  updating  the  screen  each  time  the
                    pointer  moves.  You can stop the motion by typing
                    any non-keypad key.  The character typed  to  stop
                    the  motion  is  otherwise  ignored.   Motion also
                    stops (and the bell sounds) when the text  pointer
                    reaches the beginning or end of the buffer.


          Command:  Advance Screen Image

          Meaning:  Advance the text pointer  the  correct  number  of
                    lines  to  move  the  current  bottom  line of the
                    screen to just off the top of  the  screen.   This
                    allows  you  to  'page'  through  the text buffer.
                    Overflow lines (lines too long for the screen) and
                    overprint  lines  will cause slightly more or less
                    than one screen's worth of data to be passed over.

          Meaning:  Back up the text pointer  the  correct  number  of
                    lines  to  move the current top line of the screen
                    to just off the bottom of the screen.  This allows
                    you  to  'page' through the text buffer.  Overflow

          Syntax:   $6        (ESCape, 6 keypad key)                    _

          Meaning:  Back up the text pointer  the  correct  number  of
                    characters  position  it  to where it was prior to
                    the last operation.  For example, if you have just
                    saved some text with the BLUE/PF1 keypad key, then
                    this would re-position you to  the  start  of  the

                       Searching Text


          Command:  Set Search Argument and Search Text Buffer

          Syntax:   [n]ENTER  (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Get a search argument from the keyboard and search
                    for  the  nth  occurence of it in the text buffer.
                    When you type the ENTER key, VTEDIT erases the top
                    two  lines  of  the  screen  and prompts you for a
                    search  argument  with  'Buffer  search:'.    Your
                    previous search argument (from any kind of search)
                    is initially displayed following the  prompt.   If
                    you  wish  to reuse your previous argument, simply
                    type either the keypad  period  (.)  or  a  double
                    ESCape.   To  edit your previous argument, type an
                    initial RUBOUT.  This deletes the  last  character
                    of  your  argument, but retains the rest as if you
                    had just entered it.  Further editing and/or entry
                    is  now done in the normal way.  Any other initial
                    keystroke  erases  the  entire   previous   search
                    argument;   you  may now proceed to enter your new
                    argument.  The search argument may  be  any  valid
                    TECO search construct.  Your search string appears
                    on the screen as you type.  You can use RUBOUT  to
                    edit  your  typing,  and  you  can  type CTRL/U to
                    abandon the entry of the search string, abort  the
                    search command, and clean up the screen.  When you
                    are ready to perform the search, type  either  the
                    keypad  period  (.)  or  a  double ESCape.  VTEDIT
                    cleans up the screen, saves the  search  argument,
                    and  positions the pointer after the nth occurence
                    of the string within the text  buffer.   If  n  is
                    negative,  the  search  is  done  backwards in the
                    buffer.  If the string is found and  there  is  no
                    active  mark  set,  the  found  string is shown in
                    reverse video (on those terminals that support it)
                    until  the  next  keystroke.  If the string is not
                    found, VTEDIT moves the pointer to  the  start  of
                    the text buffer and sounds the bell.

          Command:  Set Search Argument and Search through File

          Syntax:   [n]CTRL/N

          Meaning:  This command is similar to the previous  one,  but
                    performs  a through the whole file search.  If you
                    do not have an open output file, the terminal bell
                    rings  and  the command is ignored.  The prompt is
                    'File search:'.  During the  file  searching,  the

          Meaning:  This command is similiar to the previous one,  but
                    doesn't  output  passed over text.  If you have an
                    open output file  and  destructive  mode  (bit  1,
                    value  2)  in  the TECO edit mode flag (ED) is not
                    set, the terminal bell rings and  the  command  is
                    ignored.    The   prompt   is   'Destructive  file
                    search:'.  During the file searching,  the  cursor
                    is  positioned  in  the  upper  left corner of the
                    screen.  If the nth occurance is  not  found,  the
                    bell sounds (the text buffer will be empty).

          Command:  Search Again

          Syntax:   [n].      (keypad key)

          Meaning:  Search in the text buffer for the nth occurence of
                    the  search argument which was most recently saved
                    via any search command.  If  n  is  negative,  the
                    search  is  done  backwards in the buffer.  If you
                    have  not  yet  used  the  ENTER  command,  VTEDIT
                    searches for the string you most recently searched
                    for from TECO before you started VTEDIT.   If  the
                    string  is  not found, VTEDIT moves the pointer to
                    the start of the text buffer and sounds the bell.

                    If  you  do  not  have  an  open  output file, the
                    terminal bell sounds and the command is ignored.

          Command:  Append Page or Line

          Syntax:   [n]CTRL/A

          Meaning:  Append the next n pages from the input file to the
                    current  text  buffer.  If n is 0, append only one
                    line from the  file.   If  n  is  negative  (e.g.,
                    $-CTRL/A),  keep  appending  pages  from the input                    _
                    file until end-of-file.  If there are  form  feeds
                    separating  the  text  in the file, VTEDIT inserts
                    form feeds in the text buffer.

          Syntax:   [n]$CTRL/A                       _

          Meaning:  Append the next n pages from the input file to the
                    current  text  buffer,  discarding  any form feeds
                    that appear in the input file.  If n  is  negative
                    (e.g.,  $-$CTRL/A),  keep appending pages from the                            _ _
                    input file until end-of-file.  If n is  0,  append
                    only one line from the file.

                    [n]$Y                       _

          Meaning:  Yank n pages, leaving the nth  page  in  the  text
                    buffer.   If  you  have  an  open  output file and
                    destructive mode (bit 1, value 2) in  TECO's  edit
                    mode flag (ED) is not set, the terminal bell rings

                  Executing TECO commands


          Command:  Execute Q-register Macro

          Syntax:   [n]CTRL/Eq

          Meaning:  Execute the  macro  in  Q-register  q.   If  n  is
                    present,  use  its  value  as  an  argument to the
                    macro;   if  not,  execute  the  macro   with   no
                    argument.  VTEDIT moves the cursor to the top left
                    corner of the screen  while  the  macro  is  being
                    executed.

          Command:  Repeat Q-register Macro

          Syntax:   [n]$CTRL/Eq                       _

          Meaning:  Execute the macro in Q-register q in an  iteration
                    loop.  If the value of n is zero, the iteration is
                    infinite.  Otherwise, n is the iteration count for
                    the  loop.  If n is not given, this command is the
                    same as CTRL/Eq.

          In TECO:  n< Mq > or < Mq >


          Command:  Set TECO Command and Execute

          Syntax:   [n]RED    (VT52 keypad key)
                    [n]PF2    (VT100 or VT200 keypad key)

          Meaning:  Get a TECO command from the keyboard  and  execute
                    it.   When you type the RED/PF2 keypad key, VTEDIT
                    erases the top two lines of the screen and prompts
                    you  for  a command.  Your previous command string
                    is initially displayed  following  the  'Command:'
                    prompt.   If  you  wish  to  reuse  your  previous
                    command, simply type either the keypad period  (.)
                    or   a  double  ESCape.   To  edit  your  previous
                    command, type an initial RUBOUT.  This deletes the
                    last  character  of  your command, but retains the
                    rest as if  you  had  just  entered  it.   Further
                    editing  and/or  entry  is  now done in the normal
                    way.   Any  other  initial  keystroke  erases  the
                    entire  previous  command  string;   you  may  now
                    proceed to enter your new command.  You may  enter
                    any  valid  TECO  command  string.   Your  command
                    string appears on the screen as you type.  You can
                    use  RUBOUT  to edit your typing, and you can type
                    CTRL/U to abandon the entry of the command, bypass
                    command  execution, and clean up the screen.  When

                    you are ready to execute  the  command,  type  the
                    keypad  period  (.)  or  a  double ESCape.  VTEDIT
                    cleans up the screen, saves  the  command  string,
                    and executes the command.  VTEDIT moves the cursor
                    to the top left corner of  the  screen  while  the
                    command is being executed.

                    If n is present, its value is used as an  argument
                    to the TECO command string.

                    NOTE:  VTEDIT truely stores the  TECO  command  in
                    Q-register  9.  A subsequent CTRL/G 9 command will
                    insert the command into the text buffer.  To  save
                    the  command in an alphabetic Q-register for later

                    CTRL/G 9  Get TECO command from Q-register 9
                    CTRL/T q  Take command away to Q-register q


          Command:  Re-execute TECO Command

          Syntax:   [n]$$                       __

          Meaning:  Execute the TECO command most  recently  set  with
                    the  RED/PF2  keypad key.  VTEDIT moves the cursor
                    to the top left corner of  the  screen  while  the
                    command is being executed.

                    If n is present, its value is used as an  argument
                    to the TECO command.


          Command:  Set TECO Command and Repeat Execution

          Syntax:   [n]$RED   (VT52 keypad key)                       _
                    [n]$PF2   (VT100 or VT200 keypad key)                       _

          Meaning:  A TECO command is gotten from  the  keyboard  just
                    like  the  RED/PF2  command.  If n is present, the
                    TECO command is executed n times.  Else  the  TECO
                    command is executed in an infinite iteration.

          Command:  Start/End Learning Mode

          Syntax:   $L                    _

          Meaning:  VTEDIT can 'learn'  a  series  of  keystrokes  and
                    (re-)execute  them  upon  request.   An initial $L                                                                    _
                    puts VTEDIT into learning mode.  Every  subsequent
                    keystroke is remembered by VTEDIT until another $L                                                                    _
                    is typed.  To cancel  a  learned  sequence  or  to
                    ensure  that you are out of learning mode, type $L                                                                    _
                    until the terminal bell sounds.  The bell  signals
                    that  the  null learning sequence (i.e., $L$L) has                                                             _ _

          Command:  Execute Learned Sequence

          Syntax:   [n]$X                       _

          Meaning:  This command causes  VTEDIT  to  (re-)execute  the
                    previously  learned keystroke sequence.  If you do
                    not have any  learning  sequence  remembered,  the
                    terminal   bell   rings.    The  optional  numeric
                    argument is the number of  times  to  execute  the
                    learned keystroke sequence.

               Controlling the Video Terminal


          Command:  Repaint Screen

          Syntax:   CTRL/W

          Meaning:  Repaint the screen.  This command is useful if the
                    display  on the screen is destroyed by a broadcast
                    from  the  system  manager.   This  command   also
                    restores   special  keypad  mode  on  the  editing
                    keypad, and  can  be  used  if  the  terminal  was
                    powered down.

                    VTEDIT requests your terminal to send its terminal
                    id   as   part   of  this  command.   You  should,
                    therefore,   wait   until   the    screen    stops
                    updating/flickering  before  further  typing.   As
                    part of the screen repaint,  a  series  of  ESCape
                    sequences are sent to the terminal.  On VT52's and
                    VT100's or VT200's in VT52  mode,  the  characters
                    "?2l"  will appear briefly on the screen.  This is
                    normal  and  is  part  of  the  necessary   ESCape
                    sequences.


          Command:  Set Cursor Line

          Syntax:   nCTRL/W

          Meaning:  The cursor line is set to  n.   The  scope  driver
                    will try to keep the cursor on the nth line of the
                    screen.  The initial value of this cursor line  is
                    2/3rd's of the way down the screen (16 for 24 line
                    screens).

                    An effective  CTRL/W  command  is  executed  after
                    setting  the  cursor  line;  please read the notes
                    above.


          Command:  Toggle See-all Display Mode

          Syntax:   CTRL/V

          Meaning:  This command turns on  the  scope  driver  see-all
                    mode, or turns it off if it is currently on.


     VTEDIT  V03.00                                            Page 26


          Command:  Set Terminal Characteristics

          Syntax:   nCTRL/V

          Meaning:  Change  the   display   characteristics   of   the
                    terminal.   VTEDIT  requests your terminal to send
                    its terminal id as  part  of  this  command.   You
                    should,  therefore,  wait  until  the screen stops
                    updating/flickering before further typing.  If you
                    have     selected     some     illegal    terminal
                    characteristic,  VTEDIT  should   catch   it   and
                    automatically establish something that will work.

                    If n has the  value  0,  VTEDIT  tells  the  scope
                    driver  that  your  terminal  is a VT52.  Use this
                    command only if TECO made a wrong  guess  when  it
                    started  (which shouldn't happen) or if you detach
                    and  change  terminal  types  during  an   editing
                    session.  The value 2 means that the terminal is a
                    VT100 or VT200, but should be controlled  in  VT52
                    compatibility  mode.   The  value 4 means that the
                    terminal  is  a  VT100  or  VT200  and  should  be
                    controlled  with  ANSI  standard escape sequences.
                    This is the optimal setting  for  VT100  or  VT200
                    terminals, and must be used if you want to display
                    132 columns or to display  the  marked  region  in
                    reverse  video.   When you change modes on a VT100
                    or VT200,  the  VTEDIT  sends  the  proper  escape
                    sequence to the terminal to change its operation.

                    If n has an even value from 10 to 132, that  value
                    is  used  as  the  new width for the display.  You
                    must be in VT100 or VT200 ANSI mode to set a width
                    greater  than  80.   You  can set a width narrower
                    than terminal can display.  Setting a width  wider
                    than   your   terminal   can   handle   may  cause
                    unpredicatble results.  Note that the scope driver
                    reserves the last two characters of each line, and
                    therefore can display only n-2 characters  if  the
                    width  is  set  to  n.   The  default  width is 80
                    characters when you start VTEDIT.

                    If n has a negative value from 10 to 24,  it  sets
                    the  height  of  the  display.  You should not use
                    this command, unless you have a VT100 or VT200  in
                    ANSI  mode  which has the capability to change the
                    hardware scrolling region.

          Meaning:  This command toggles "holding  screen"  mode.   In
                    normal mode (the default), VTEDIT attempts to keep
                    the cursor positioned on the line specified by the
                    nCTRL/W command.  Any advance or back line command
                    will scroll the screen one line thus  keeping  the
                    cursor  in  the  same  physical  location  on  the
                    screen.  In holding screen mode, VTEDIT will  only
                    scroll  the  screen when the cursor position would
                    have been off the screen.  For example, an advance
                    line  from  the  last line on the screen or a back
                    line from the top line on the  screen  will  cause
                    the   screen  to  scroll  and  the  cursor  to  be
                    positioned  at  its  default  location,  the  line
                    specified  by  nCTRL/W.   This  mode is useful for
                    terminals without reverse  scrolling  capabilities
                    and/or    for   operation   over   a   low   speed
                    communication lines.

                    If n is present  and  has  the  value  0,  holding
                    screen  mode  is unconditionally turned off;  if n
                    is -1,  holding  screen  mode  is  unconditionally
                    turned on.

                    If n is positive, holding screen mode is turned on
                    with  the cursor limit set to n.  VTEDIT will only
                    scroll the screen if  the  cursor  position  would
                    have  been within the top or bottom n lines on the
                    screen.

                 Selecting Word Delimiters

     Several of the VTEDIT editing commands use the idea of  a  'word'
     in  the  text buffer.  Normally, words are delimited by sequences
     of spaces, tabs, commas, carriage returns, and  line  feeds.   If
     you  have  a  special  editing  application,  you  may  require a
     different definition of a word.  The following commands allow you
     to change that definition.


          Command:  Use Standard Words

          Syntax:   $T                    _

          Meaning:  Restore the set of word delimiters to the standard
                    set:   space,  tab,  comma,  carriage return, line
                    feed.


          Command:  Use BASIC-PLUS Words

          Syntax:   $0$T                    _ _

          Meaning:  Use a  set  of  word  delimiters  appropriate  for
                    editing BASIC-PLUS code.  This command appends the
                    following special characters to the  set  of  word
                    delimiters:

                    ( ) + - * ^ \ ! = : < > /


          Command:  Clear Delimiter Set

          Syntax:   $-$T                    _ _

          Meaning:  Clear out the word delimiter set.  You must follow
                    this command by adding one or more word delimiters
                    (see below).


          Command:  Add Word Delimiter

          Syntax:   n$T                     _

          Meaning:  Add the character whose ASCII value is  n  to  the
                    set  of  word  delimiters.  The value of n must be
                    between 1 and 127.

          Command:  Get Next Word

          Syntax:   [n]$N                       _

          Meaning:  Move the next n words to the current line.   If  n
                    is  positive, the cursor should be at the end of a
                    line;  the first n words of the next  line(s)  are
                    moved  to  the  end  of the current line.  If n is
                    negative, the cursor should be at the beginning of
                    a  line;  the last n words of the previous line(s)
                    are moved to the beginning of the current line.

                          Exiting


          Command:  Exit from VTEDIT

          Syntax:   CTRL/Z or CTRL/C

          Meaning:  Exit from  the  Video  Terminal  Editor  macro  to
                    TECO's asterisk prompt.


          Command:  Exit from TECO

          Syntax:   $CTRL/Z                    _

          Meaning:  Exit from the Video Terminal Editor macro and from
                    TECO,  copying  the  input file to the output file
                    and closing both files.  This  command  turns  off
                    special  keypad  mode  and moves the cursor to the
                    bottom of the screen.

          In TECO:  EX


          Command:  Exit from TECO Without Preserving Output

          Syntax:   $-CTRL/Z                    _

          Meaning:  Delete any output file which may be open, undo any
                    edit  backup  in effect, and exit from TECO.  This
                    command turns off special keypad  mode  and  moves
                    the cursor to the bottom of the screen.

                     Numeric Arguments

     Simple  numeric  arguments  consist  of  ESCape  (or  the  ESCape
     surrogate),  an  optional minus sign, and a digit string which is
     always interpreted in decimal.   None  of  the  keystrokes  of  a
     simple numeric argument echo on the terminal.

     More advanced numeric arguments can be expressions using standard
     arithmetic  operators.   These  numeric arguments also start with
     ESCape or the ESCape surrogate,  an  optional  minus  sign,  and,
     then,  a digit.  If the first non-digit typed is one of the valid
     operators listed below, expression mode is entered.  The top line
     of the display is erased and a line of the form:

              Radix x, Expression arg1 op arg2

     is displayed.  The initial radix is 10, arg1 will be the  initial
     digit string, and op will be the operator.

     Further digit string typing will fill in arg2 until  a  non-digit
     is   typed.   If  it  is  another  valid  operator,  the  current
     arg1 op arg2  expression  will  be  evaluated,  the  result  will
     replace  arg1, arg2 will be set to zero, and op will be the typed
     operator.

     If it is  a  radix  change  command,  the  radix  is  immediately
     changed.   No  evaluation  of  the  expression occurs.  The radix
     change is local to the current numeric  expression;   it  is  not
     subsequently remembered.

     If it is an arg2 stand-in, the current arg2 is  replaced  by  the
     specified value.

     If it is RUBOUT, the current arg2 is reset to zero.

     If it is CTRL/U, the  entire  expression  is  abandoned  and  the
     display is fixed up.

     Else it is  assumed  to  be  an  editing  command.   The  current
     arg1 op arg2 will be evaluated and the result becomes the numeric
     argument to that command.

     The valid numeric expression operators are:

          +  Addition
          -  Subtraction
          *  Multiplication
          /  Division
          #  Logical .OR.
          &  Logical .AND.
          =  Evaluate current arg1 op arg2

     The valid radix change commands are:

          ^D Change radix to decimal (base 10)
          ^O Change radix to octal (base 8)
          ^X Change radix to hexidecimal (base 16)

     The valid arg2 stand-ins are:

          ^. Current value of the text buffer pointer
          ^Z Current total number of characters in the text buffer
          ^^x The value of character 'x'

                   Miscellaneous Commands


          Command:  Find Front of File

          Syntax:   $F                    _

          Meaning:  The current file open for editing  is  closed  out
                    and,  then, re-opened.  You are left positioned at
                    the first page  of  the  file.   If  you  have  no
                    current  output  file the terminal bell sounds and
                    the command is ignored.

          In TECO:  EC EBfile$ Y                             _


          Command:  Worry About Operating System Crashing

          Syntax:   $1$F                    _ _

          Meaning:  Close out the file  currently  open  for  editing,
                    re-open  it,  and  re-find  your  current  editing
                    position.  Similiar  to  the  command  above,  but
                    automatically  re-positions  you to where you left
                    off editing.   This  command  is  useful  if  your
                    operating system tends to crash...


          Command:  Exit from TECO Marking Position

          Syntax:   $0$F                    _ _

          Meaning:  Close out the  file  currently  open  for  editing
                    marking  the  current  editing  position.   TECO's
                    memory file (TECFnn.TMP) is updated to reflect the
                    file  currently  being edited and the /FIND switch
                    is  appended  to  the  file  specification.   This
                    command  is  used  in conjunction with the command
                    below.


          Command:  Find Marked Position

          Syntax:   $-$F                    _ _

          Meaning:  (Re-)find marked editing  position.   The  editing
                    position  marked  by some previous $0$F command is                                                       _ _
                    re-found.

          Command:  Redisplay Keypad Layout

          Syntax:   $H                    _

          Meaning:  Clear the screen and display the help text for the
                    Video Terminal Editing macro.  Type any non-keypad
                    character to redisplay the text window and  resume
                    editing.   VTEDIT  does  not insert that character
                    into the text.


          Command:  Set Left Margin

          Syntax:   [n]$M                       _

          Meaning:  Set the left margin at column n.  If you have  set
                    a  left  margin,  the VTEDIT automatically inserts
                    enough tabs and spaces to get the  cursor  to  the
                    margin  whenever  you type a carriage return or an
                    open line command (7 key  on  keypad).   If  n  is
                    negative,  VTEDIT  sets  the margin to -n and uses
                    only spaces for filling.  If n is not present, the
                    margin  is set at the current column.  If there is
                    any text on the  line  when  this  you  give  this
                    command, VTEDIT shifts it to the new margin.
