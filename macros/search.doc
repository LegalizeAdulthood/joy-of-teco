              SEARCH.TEC - the wildcard file searching macro

     SEARCH will scan one or more wildcarded sets  of  files  for  all
     occurances  of  one  or more strings.  Each match is displayed in
     the log file with the character "~" immediately after the matched
     string.  SEARCH also has a change mode (i.e., find and replace).

     You use the MUNG command to invoke SEARCH and it  enters  into  a
     dialogue with you.

     The "Output:" question directs SEARCH's log  file.   The  default
     log  file  is  to  your  terminal;  the default file extension is
     .SRH.  If you are doing a change mode run,  you  place  the  /CHA
     switch  on your answer to this question.  If the strings you wish
     to search for  (or  the  replacement  strings)  contain  embedded
     CR/LF's, you must add the /ESC switch to this question.  When you
     say /ESC, your responses to the Search:  (and Replace:) questions
     will  be  terminated  only by ESCape;  normally, either RETURN or
     ESCape is the terminator.  You can always use DELete (RUBOUT) and
     CTRL/U to edit your responses.

     The "Input:" question is asking for an optionally wildcarded file
     specification.    The   default  file  extension  is  .MAC.   You
     terminate supplying file specifications by responding with simply
     RETURN.

     The "Lines:" question determines the number of extra lines around
     the  found line to place in the log file.  An answer of 0 results
     in only the found line;  the default value is 3.

     The "Search:" question accepts the string(s) to search for.   All
     normal  TECO  search  constructs are allowed.  Terminate entering
     search strings with simply RETURN (or ESCape if you said /ESC).

     The "Replace:" question will only appear if you  specified  /CHA.
     After  each  Search:   is  responded  to, you enter a replacement
     string for the last entered search string.

     The "Detach:"  question  directs  SEARCH  to  detach  during  the
     searching.  The default is to stay attached.
