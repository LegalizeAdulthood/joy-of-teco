            LOCAL.TEC - the MACRO local symbol reordering macro

     This macro will reorder local symbol blocks in MACRO-11 (.MAC) or
     MACRO/VAX (.MAR) programs.

     LOCAL.TEC  is  loaded  into  Q-register  L  by  using  EI  (e.g.,
     EILOCAL$).

     Saying ML$$ will reorder the  local  symbol  block  in  the  text
     buffer  setting  the  first  local  symbol to 10$ and going up in
     increments of 10.

     Saying nML$$ will reorder starting at n (the increment stays 10).

     The increment can be changed by nUL.
