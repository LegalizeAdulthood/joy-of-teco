The CHANGE program functions like the VAX/VMS SEARCH command, but allows
the user to make global changes across several files.

Under VMS, define a symbol for the CHANGE command that looks something
like this:

	CH*ANGE :== $SYS$SYSTEM:TECO MUNG SYS$SYSTEM:CHANGE

	This assumes that you have TECO loaded into SYS$SYSTEM ([SYSEXE])
and have loaded CHANGE.TEC into the same directory.

CHANGE designed to be used by people familiar with the SEARCH program,
so the prompts are almost identical. CHANGE asks you for the file name(s)
you want the changes to occur in (wildcards are ok). It then prompts for
the string to be replaced and the new replacement string to be used.

	A shortcoming of the SEARCH program is that it can't search for
strings containing carriage return/line feed pairs. CHANGE will handle these
strings. It accepts the two strings arguments in one of two ways:

	1. the regular way, carriage return or escape ends the string

	2. the delimited way. The user hits an escape key when prompted
	   for the string. The escape is not echoed and is not a part
	   of the string. Only an escape can terminate the string.

	Another advantage of the CHANGE program is that, since it builds
and executes a TECO command string, TECO pattern matching characters (like
^Ed (match a digit) ^Es (match any sequence of spaces and tabs) ^Ex (match
any single character), etc.) are allowed in the search string. Also, TECO
case significance control (^V, ^W, etc.) is also legal. Refer to a TECO
manual for a full description of TECO search strings.

	File CHANGE.TES contains the documented source code for the program.
It can be executed. It takes a short while to compress it for speed. The basic
idea is to find the labels, remember their locations, then delete all tags
and re-insert the labels.
